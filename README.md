Educational application for Android.


This project has the objective to develop an educational platform targeted at children with physical disabilities, mainly cerebral palsy.
By providing swipe compatibility and multiple types of exercises, all configurable using JSON files, it aims to provide educators and families the tools needed to better interact and teach with those children.

Currently the application has currently the client module, intended for the children to use.

Later in the development it will be created a module to allow the setting of all the existent exercises and a server to allow the comunication between the other two modules.
